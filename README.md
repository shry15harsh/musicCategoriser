Music Files Categoriser

I often find it troublesome to move my new downloaded media files to their respective locations.

Plus, I used to sort them using Movie Names for Hindi Songs and Artist Names for English Songs.

So I thought why not make an application which can automate this feature and here I come with this one.

Currently, this application is hard coded to search all .mp3 files in my folder and moves them to my target folder in their respective albums.

I want this application to be flexible. Like one can sort by artist or album name or by artist name and then album name.

Also, I want to add many more features later.

Now, I am onto GUI version of this application.

This application uses TagLib library to read media file tags.

Feel free to contact me regarding this application and to suggest some feature or ideas.
